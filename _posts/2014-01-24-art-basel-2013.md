We had a blast in Miami during Art Basel 2013. We met up with some old friends
and met some great new friends and artists. We were really busy doing a crew
wall and then we were lucky enough to meet and paint an extra piece with a
real pioneer of Graffiti writing: DocTc5 aka Arab.  It is always a pleasure
to hear some great stories of when kids started doing graffiti in the 70's
in NYC, from a person that really lived it!

This posts more about the great vibe in Wynwood more than the art fair and
gallery exhibition happening in downtown.

We will be back at Art Basel 2014 for sure!
