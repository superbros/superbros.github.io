We highly recommend to go and check The Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait
Prize 2013 exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. It was amazing to walk
around and see the work of some of the most talented emerging young
photographers, alongside that of established professionals, photography
students and gifted amateurs.

The exhibition will run until 9 February 2014 at the
[National Portrait Gallery](http://www.npg.org.uk), London.
